Definition:
    Trend-following strategies involve identifying and trading in the direction of an existing market trend,
    aiming to profit from the continuation of price movements, whether upward or downward.

1. Moving Average Crossover Strategy:
    Buy: When the short-term moving average (e.g., 50-day MA) crosses above the long-term moving average (e.g., 200-day MA)
    Sell: When the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average

2. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Strategy:
    Buy: When the RSI falls below 30 (indicating the stock is oversold)
    Sell: When the RSI rises above 70 (indicating the stock is overbought)

3. Bollinger Bands Strategy:
    Buy: When the price touches the lower Bollinger Band (indicating the stock is potentially oversold)
    Sell: When the price touches the upper Bollinger Band (indicating the stock is potentially overbought)

4. Mean Reversion Strategy: 
    Buy: When a stock falls below its 20-day moving average by a certain percentage (e.g., 5%)
    Sell: When the stock price reverts back to or above the 20-day moving average

5. Breakout Strategy:
    Buy: When the stock price breaks above a defined resistance level (e.g., the 30-day high)
    Sell: When the stock price breaks below a defined support level (e.g., the 30-day low)
